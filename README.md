# My Portfolio

This project is a personal portfolio website built using Flask, a Python web framework. It showcases my skills, projects, and provides a way for potential clients or employers to contact me.

## Features

* **Responsive Design:** Adapts to different screen sizes for optimal viewing on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
* **Modern UI:**  Utilizes Bootstrap 5 for a clean and professional look.
* **Dynamic Content:**  Content is served dynamically using Flask's templating engine (Jinja2).
* **Contact Form:**  Allows visitors to easily get in touch.
* **Resume Download:** Provides a direct link to download my resume.
* **Project Showcase:**  Displays a selection of my projects with brief descriptions (currently placeholder content).


## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

* **Python 3:** Make sure you have Python 3 installed on your system.  You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).
* **Flask:**  Install Flask using pip:
  ```bash
  pip install Flask
  ```
* **Bootstrap 5:**  The project uses Bootstrap 5 for styling. It's included in the `static` directory, so you do not need to install it using `pip`, or include `<link>` tags within templates, as it's already set up in the base template.
* **Other Dependencies (Based on your `portfolio.py` file if applicable):** Install any other Python packages your portfolio might use (e.g. `flask_wtf`, `flask_sqlalchemy` etc) using pip:
    ```bash
    pip install <package_name>
    ```



### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>  # Replace with your repository URL
   ```
2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
   ```bash
   cd my-portfolio
   ```
3. **Set Up Virtual Environment (Recommended):**  Create and activate a virtual environment (highly recommended to keep your project dependencies isolated):
    * Create a virtual environment: `python3 -m venv venv` or `virtualenv venv` (depending on which virtualenv tool you have installed)
    * Activate it: `venv\Scripts\activate` (Windows) or `source venv/bin/activate` (MacOS/Linux). This will change your terminal's prompt, showing `(venv)` to indicate it is active.
4. **Install Requirements:** Install all required Python packages using pip:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt  # If you have a requirements file.
    ```
5. **Run the App:** Start the Flask development server:
   ```bash
   flask run
   ```

### Usage

Open your web browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` to view the portfolio.
